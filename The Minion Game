Kevin and Stuart want to play the 'The Minion Game'.

Game Rules

Both players are given the same string, S .
Both players have to make substrings using the letters of the string  S.
Stuart has to make words starting with consonants.
Kevin has to make words starting with vowels.
The game ends when both players have made all possible substrings.

Scoring
A player gets +1 point for each occurrence of the substring in the string S.

For Example:
String  S = BANANA
Kevin's vowel beginning word = ANA
Here, ANA occurs twice in BANANA. Hence, Kevin will get 2 Points.

For better understanding, see the image below:
Your task is to determine the winner of the game and their score.

Input Format

A single line of input containing the string S.
Note: The string  S will contain only uppercase letters: .

Constraints
0<len(S)<10**6

Output Format

Print one line: the name of the winner and their score separated by a space.

If the game is a draw, print Draw.

Sample Input
BANANA

Sample Output
Stuart 12

Note :
Vowels are only defined as "AEIOU". In this problem, "Y" is not considered a vowel.

*****************************************************EXPLANATION*****************************************************
Ex:
BANANA
Words(substrings) starts with B
B, BA, BAN, BANA, BANAN, BANANA        Total = 6

Words(substrings) starting with next letter A
A, AN, ANA, ANAN, ANANA        Total = 5

Words(substrings) starting with next letter N
N, NA, NAN, NANA        Total = 4

Words(substrings) starting with next letter A
A, AN, ANA        Total = 3

Words(substrings) starting with next letter N
N, NA        Total = 2

Words(substrings) starting with next letter A
A        Total = 1

Now count the total only with vowels i.e. 5+3+1 = 9
count the total only with consonants i.e. 6+4+2 = 12

Count of consonants > count of vovwels
so, Stuart wins with value 12

    for i in range(length):
        if string[i].upper() in 'AEIOU':        # just in case if the string is in lower case instead of upper, we have to convert it to upper.
            vowel = vowel + (length - i)
        else:
            consonant = consonant + (length - i)
    if vowel > consonant:
        print("Kevin",vowel)
    elif vowel == consonant:
        print("Draw")
    else:
        print("Stuart",consonant)
